Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run". <br />

You can use Spring Boot to create stand-alone Java applications that can be started using ```java -jar``` or more traditional WAR deployments. We also provide a command line tool that runs spring scripts.

## Examples
* ### spring-boot-url
  Spring Boot client that call URLs.
