> These Java examples cover Spring Boot.

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

You can use Spring Boot to create stand-alone Java applications that can be started using ```java -jar``` or more traditional WAR deployments. We also provide a command line tool that runs spring scripts.
